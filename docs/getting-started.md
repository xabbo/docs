# Getting Started

## Minimum requirements

To begin developing extensions with xabbo, install the
[.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0). You can verify that the SDK
has been installed correctly with the following commands:

```sh
❯ dotnet --version
8.0.108

❯ dotnet --list-sdks
8.0.108 [/usr/share/dotnet/sdk]
```

Once that has been installed you can continue with the [tutorial](tutorial/index.md) to learn how to
create extensions with xabbo.

If you are just looking for a quick start on how to do things using the xabbo extension API,
[add the packages](how-to/add-xabbo.md) to your project and check out the how to pages on the left.
